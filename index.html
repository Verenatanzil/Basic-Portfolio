            <img src="assets/images/myphoto.jpg" class="myphoto" alt="profile_picture">I have always been very passionate about design since I was a little kid. My father owns a small store and I have a very fond memory of it. I remember that I used to be very excited when new products were coming to the store because then I would be able to create brochures and flyers for the new products.

            <br>
            <p class="aboutme2">
             Because of that experience, I decided to pursue design as my major in college. I knew that I had to do something extra to hone my skills as a designer by doing other things than just studying design at school. I work as the page designer for my school's newspaper organization.

            <p class="aboutme3">    
            My goal right now is to work in a company that enables me to work with people I can learn from. I also like to go to a graduate school as I believe that there is no limit when it comes to gaining knowledge.
